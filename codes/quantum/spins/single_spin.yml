code_id: single_spin
physical: spins

name: 'Single-spin code'

description: |
  Permutation invariant qubit code encoding a \(K\)-dimensional Hilbert space into the maximally symmetric subspace or \textit{collective spin} of \(2\ell\) spin-half systems.
  This \(2\ell+1\)-dimensional Hilbert space can be thought of as a standalone spin-\(\ell\) quantum system.

protection: |
  Noise models can be categorized as those that cause the state to leave the maximally symmetric subspace and those that do not. The former include single-spin errors akin to qubit Pauli noise. The latter include collective rotations or decays.

features:
  transversal_gates: 'When the physical Hilbert space is thought of a collective spin, logical gates for spin codes have the form \(U^{\otimes N}\), where \(U\) is a local rotation on the physical system.'

      detail: 'Single-spin codes are subspaces of a single large spin, which can be either standalone or correspond to the permutation-invariant subspace of a set of spins.'
