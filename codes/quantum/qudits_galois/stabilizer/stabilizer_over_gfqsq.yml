code_id: stabilizer_over_gfqsq
physical: galois
logical: galois

name: 'Stabilizer code over \(GF(q^2)\)'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0508070}'

description: |
  An \([[n,k,d]]_q\) Galois-qudit stabilizer code constructed from a classical code over \(GF(q^2)\) using the one-to-one correspondence between the Galois-qudit Pauli matrices and elements of the Galois field \(GF(q^2)\).

  An \(n\) Galois-qudit Pauli stabilizer can be represented as a length-\(n\) vector over \(GF(q^2)\). The stabilizer commutation condition corresponds to a zero trace-alternating inner product between the corresponding vectors. Stabilizer codes over \(GF(q^2)\) can thus be constructed from classical trace-alternating self-orthogonal additive codes over \(GF(q^2)\) \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0508070}.
  Hermitian self-orthogonal linear codes over \(GF(q^2)\) are automatically trace-alternating self-orthogonal, and applying this construction to such codes yields a class of true stabilizer codes.

#  The classical code corresponds to the stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\) while \(C^{\perp}\) corresponds to the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\).

      detail: 'Trace-alternating self-orthogonal linear codes over \(GF(q^2)\) are equivalent to a class of true stabilizer codes \cite{preset:GottesmanBook}. Hermitian self-orthogonal linear codes over \(GF(q^2)\) are automatically trace-alternating self-orthogonal and can be used to construct true stabilizer codes via the \hyperref[code:stabilizer_over_gfqsq]{stabilizer-over-\(GF(q^2)\)} construction (\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0508070}, Corr. 19).'

      detail: 'The stabilizer commutation condition for stabilizer codes over \(GF(q^2)\) can equivalently be stated in the representation of stabilizers as vectors over \(GF(q^2)\).
      A pair of \(n\) Galois-qudit stabilizers commute iff the trace-alternating inner product of their their corresponding vectors is zero.
      Stabilizer codes over \(GF(q^2)\) can thus be constructed from trace-alternating self-orthogonal additive codes over \(GF(q^2)\).'
