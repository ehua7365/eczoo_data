description: |
  Also known as a \textit{group code}.
  An \( [n,k]_q \) code based on a finite group \( G \) of size \(n \).
  A group-algebra code for an abelian group is called an \textit{abelian group-algebra code}.

  The code is a \( k \)-dimensional linear subspace of the group algebra of \( G\) with coefficients in the field \(GF(q) = \mathbb{F}_q\) with \(q\) elements. To be precise, the code must be closed under permutations corresponding to the elements of the group \( G \); therefore, \( G \) must be a subgroup of the permutation automorphism group of the code, which is defined as the group of permutations of the physical bits that preserve the code space. This leads us to the formal definition of a group-algebra code: a group-algebra code is an ideal in the group algebra \( \mathbb{F}_q G \).

#protection: 'The class of abelian group-algebra codes is very general, for example including all group-algebra codes of size \(n \leq 23 \). As such it is very difficult to say anything about the distance of abelian groups codes without specializing to a particular family'

notes:
  - 'See \cite{preset:HKSalgebra}\cite[pg. 58]{doi:10.1007/978-94-011-3810-9} for introductions to group-algebra codes.'
  - 'Not all abelian group-algebra codes are for cyclic groups (cyclic codes) or for elementary abelian \( p \) groups (e.g. Reed Muller codes \cite{doi:10.1007/BF01119999}). For example, there is a binary code with parameters \( [45,13,16] \) which is an abelian group-algebra code for the group \( G = \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_{15} \). '

      detail: 'A linear code is a group-algebra code for a group \(G\) if and only if \(G\) is isomorphic to a regular subgroup of the code''s permutation automorphism group \cite{doi:10.1007/s10623-008-9261-z}\cite[Thm. 16.4.7]{preset:HKSalgebra}.'
#Note that we have an isomorphism of \( \mathbb{F} \) algebras \( \mathbb{F}\mathbb{Z}_n \cong \mathbb{F}[x]/\langle x^n-1\rangle \) by taking  \( x \) to be the generator of the cyclic group. Thus we can see how cyclic codes are an example of an abelian group-algebra code.'
